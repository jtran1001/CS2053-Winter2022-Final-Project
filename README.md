phase 1 :The player starts out as a single cell which will go around and eat its nutrition orb. There are 2 kinds of orb Carnivore and Herbivore. each orb will give a cosmetic skin for the type of orb the cell eats. Everytime cell eats an orb -> increment cell size as well as the Total experience (Max 5 orbs) then a boss fight will get them to phase 2. (Carnivore hit the boss and drop it to 0, Herbivore run and survive until time ran out)

Phase 2: Customize specie -> add selected sprite to gameObject.

- Carnivore hunts, kills and evovles (10 orbs).

- Herbivore runs, survives and evolves (10 orbs).

Phase 3: Civilization.

- Carnivore: good combat. 

- Herbivore: good science.

Once the specie has reached the last mile stone, the specie launches their space Ship, game ends.
